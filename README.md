LLLM is a lightweight framework for developing **advanced agentic systems**. Allows users to build a complex agentic system with <100 LoC. Prioritizing minimalism, modularity, and reliability, it is specifically suitable for complex and frontier agentic systems beyond daily chat. While these fields require deep architectural customization and highly diverse demands, developers and researchers often face the burden of managing low-level complexities such as exception handling, output parsing, and API error management. LLLM bridges this gap by offering necessary abstractions that balance high-level encapsulation with the simplicity required for flexible experimentation. It also tries to make the code plain, compact, easy-to-understand, with less unnecessary indirection, thus easy for customization for different projects' needs, to allow researchers and developers to focus on the core research questions. See https://lllm.one for detailed documentation.


## Design Philosophy

- **Agentic System as a Program**:  An agentic system = agents (≈ system prompt + base model, the “callers”) + prompts (the "functions" or "calls") + the tactics (the "program" that wires the callers and functions). The agent call makes LLM agents "deterministic" callers, for minimizing side effects, maximizing compositionality, and parallelizability.
- **Dialog as Internal "Mental" State**: Dialog is the "internal mental state" of each agent due to system prompt, different bodies in a talk maintain their own internal dialog, i.e., dialog is what each agent "sees" from the others, its objective, not subjective. Dialog is also a function stack for each agent, where top_prompt is the calling convention for the next turn.
- **Configuration as Declaration**: System shape is declared in config, not hardcoded. What exists (prompts, proxies) and how it's wired (agent configs) are expressed as data.

### Advanced Features
- **Tool calling as Programming**: Besides regular tool calling provided by LLMs, LLLM provides a mini-interpreter mode that calls tools as a mini Python script, and tools are wrapped through the proxy system, which is more flexible and powerful.
- **Tactics as Shared Library**: Tactics are the reusable library for different agentic systems, ideally you can "import" a tactic from a library, and use it in your own agentic system. Each prompt, proxy, config, and tactic is a "independent" module, and they are loaded on demand through the lllm.toml file. Theoretically, you can share your tactics, prompts, proxies, configs, etc. with others, and they can use them in their own agentic systems.
- **Replayable Logging**: The logging system is designed to be replayable, which means you can replay the logging to get the exact same result as the original run, and save the entire traces and costs, etc. This is useful for debugging, A/B testing, prompt optimization, etc.


## Typical Project Structure

The agentic system in LLLM is declarative, where `AgenticSystem = Agents + Prompts + Tactics`.

```
lllm/
├── lllm.toml       # to help LLLM find the prompts, proxies, configs, and tactics folders
├── prompts/        # the prompts, for the agents to call, i.e., the functions or "calls"
├── proxies/        # the proxies, for proxy-based tool-calling, mini in-dialog interpreter
├── configs/        # the configs for the agents, i.e., the base models, system prompts, etc. and your own configs 
├── tactics/        # the tactics, which are the programs that wire the agents and prompts together
├── system.py       # a conceptual top-level encapsulation of the agentic system(s)
├── ... (other files and folders)
└── README.md
```

You can also structure your project in a more flexible way, like you can put the prompts, proxies, configs, and tactics in another place, that can be shared by multiple projects, to support multiple of your agentic systems, or you can put them in the same place, and you write multiple agentic systems in the same project.

Conceptually, LLLM maintains a huge registry of prompts, proxies, configs, and tactics, either local or shared, which are loaded on demand through the lllm.toml file. When you are building an agentic system, you usually use tactics as the building blocks or modules, and use them to compose your own agentic system. It works in this way, the tactic find agent configs for keys in `agent_group`, and finds prompts including system prompts from prompt registry. Then the proxy-based tool-calling is through the proxy registry. 

The LLLM stops at tactic as its highest level of abstraction, i.e., low-level, for the higher levels, like the system itself, the system of systems, and the network of systems, etc., please refer to the [Simple System of Systems Network (SSSN) framework](https://github.com/Productive-Superintelligence/sssn) for more details.

## Installation

```bash
pip install lllm-core
```


## Quick Start

### Basic Chat

## Examples

Check `examples/` for more usage scenarios:

### Proxies & Tools

Built-in proxies (financial data, search, etc.) register automatically when their modules are imported. If you plan to call `Proxy()` directly, either:

1. Set up an `lllm.toml` with a `[proxies]` section so discovery imports your proxy folders on startup, or
2. Call `load_builtin_proxies()` to import the packaged modules, or manually import the proxies you care about (e.g., `from lllm.proxies.builtin import exa_proxy`).

This mirrors how prompts are auto-registered via `[prompts]` in `lllm.toml`.

Once proxies are loaded you can check what is available by calling `Proxy().available()`.

### Auto-Discovery Config

A starter `lllm.toml.example` lives in the repo root. Copy it next to your project entry point and edit the folder paths:

```bash
cp lllm.toml.example lllm.toml
```

The sample configuration points to `examples/autodiscovery/prompts/` and `examples/autodiscovery/proxies/`, giving you a working prompt (`examples/hello_world`) and proxy (`examples/sample`) to experiment with immediately.

## Testing & Offline Mocks

TODO 

## Testing

Run tests with pytest:

```bash
pytest tests/
```

## Experimental Features

- **Computer Use Agent (CUA)** – `lllm.tools.cua` offers browser automation via Playwright and the OpenAI Computer Use API. It is still evolving and may change without notice.
- **Responses API Routing** – opt into OpenAI’s Responses API by setting `api_type = "response"` per agent. This enables native web search/computer-use tools but currently targets OpenAI only.


# Roadmap

## v0.1.0 Refactoring 
- [x] Refactor providers system: LiteLLM invoker (invokers/)
- [x] Refactor registry to runtime (runtime.py), and discovery system (discovery.py)
- [x] Refactor prompt model and prompt management (prompt.py)
  - [x] Prompt composition and inheritance (compose templates, config tools, etc.), using jinja or something else like dspy solutions
  - [x] More graceful tool, i.e., now it relies on `link_function`, which separates declaration and definition of a tool, if it is good?
  - [x] Clearing up ad-hoc designs, like now cua args, etc. are nakedly attatched as properties, whenever there is a new feature, it is added as a property, which is not good.
  - [x] Better parsing system, more intuitive and better argument passing, now its through a dict, which is primitive and not type safe.
  - [x] Better handling system for error, exception, interrupt, etc. (need to be co-designed with the agent parts)
  --- 
  - [-] Provide a version control solution, either allow using git or something else, to assist tuning, A/B testing, prompt optimization, etc.
    - [-] Assisting tracking system to help experiment (may also need to be co-designed with the agentic system parts)
    - [-] we do not need to build those wheels in lllm, but should be friendly to integrate with other version control or management systems. May need to refer to these solutions, so knowing how to be friendly to them. Or directly provide an interface to a popular solution (which one is the most popular?). Like having an abstract base class for all such version control, management, analysis, etc.
    - Just do not do it, any design now will be an overly pre design
- [x] Refactor message and dialog model/state management, better arg passing (dialog.py)
  - Dialog provides low-level operations, and advanced arg passings are provided by Agent etc. below
- [x] Refactor agent model, agent call (agent.py)
- [ ] -> Refactor tactics and config system (tactics.py, config.py, lllm.toml)
- [ ] Proxy-based tool-calling, mini in-dialog interpreter (proxies/)
- [ ] Logger (cli logging), replayable logging system (log.py)

## TODOs

- [ ] Default Context Manager for prune over-size dialogs
= [ ] Better sandbox, e.g., browser sandbox, code sandbox, etc. maybe use sandbox wheels (sandbox/)
- [ ] Shareable Tactics, Prompts, Proxies, Configs, etc.

## Future Roadmap

- [ ] Gradient mode for tuning/training
